## ðŸ›  **Execute Client-Side Commands in Roblox via Discord**

You can **integrate a Discord bot** into your Roblox instance, allowing you to interact with Discord from Roblox.

---

### ðŸ“‹ **Features:**
- **Control Roblox client** through Discord commands.
- Simple, WebSocket-free setup.

---

### âœ¨ **How It Works:**

By opening a local server using the Flask library, it creates two methods of command exchange between Discord and the Roblox client.

---

ðŸŽ¯ **Command Structure:**

| Command  | Action                         |
|----------|---------------------------------|
| `.say`   | Sends a message to Roblox chat. |
| `.jump`  | Makes your Roblox character jump. |

---

> **ðŸ”§ Setup Guide:**  
> 
> 1. [Download Python](https://www.python.org/)
> 2. Once the Python installer is opened, click "add to path" and then install.
> 3. Download the necessary files as a ZIP and go into that folder.
> 4. Once in the folder, open a command prompt and type in `pip install -r requirements.txt`. This will install the required packages.
> 5. Once the packages are installed, run the `Server.py`.
> 6. After initializing the server, run `Client.py`.
> 7. Join a Roblox game and inject with your executor of choice.
> 8. Then run the `client.lua` script and add your own commands to it.
